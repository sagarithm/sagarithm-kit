# Clean Code & Quality Standards

## Overview
This skill guides AI agents and engineers in authoring code that is immediately readable, strictly typed, resilient to runtime failure, and simple to maintain.

## Core Directives
1. **Strict Type Safety**: Never use `any`, untyped collections, or disable linter rules without justification. Model explicit data shapes.
2. **Prevent Primitive Obsession**: Use branded types or value objects for domain identifiers and units.
3. **Exhaustive State Handling**: Model multi-state domain flows with discriminated unions and enforce exhaustive compile-time checking (`assertNever`).
4. **Explicit Failure Modeling**: For operations where failure is an expected domain branch (validation, parsing), consider `Result<T, E>` types rather than throwing unchecked exceptions.
5. **Never Swallow Errors**: Handle errors at the appropriate layer; never leave empty catch blocks or discard stack traces.
6. **Cancellation & Concurrency Hygiene**: Support `AbortSignal` for cancellable async tasks and guard against race conditions.

## 🛑 Anti-Rationalization Matrix

| Agent Excuse / Shortcut | Quality Reality | Mandatory Action |
|---|---|---|
| *"Using `any` here just speeds things up."* | `any` is a virus that silently disables compiler checking throughout the codebase. | Model explicit TypeScript interfaces or use `unknown` with type guards. |
| *"I'll leave this `catch (e) {}` empty since it rarely fails."* | Swallowed exceptions cause invisible state corruption that takes days to debug. | Log the error or rethrow a domain-specific error. |
| *"A generic string is fine for this ID."* | Primitive obsession causes accidental bugs where user IDs are passed as order IDs. | Use branded nominal types (e.g. `UserId = string & { __brand: 'UserId' }`). |
