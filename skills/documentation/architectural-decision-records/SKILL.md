# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview
This skill guides AI agents and engineers in capturing consequential architectural decisions as living, version-controlled records. ADRs preserve institutional memory, explain the *why* behind complex designs, and prevent recurring circular debates.

## Core Directives
1. **Identify Consequential Decisions**: Not every bug fix requires an ADR; write an ADR whenever a structural choice has long-term implications or accepts explicit trade-offs.
2. **Follow MADR Standards**: Structure ADRs with clear Context, Decision Drivers, Options, Outcome, and Trade-offs.
3. **Use Quantitative Matrices for Contested Choices**: When evaluating multiple competing technologies, employ a weighted decision matrix to anchor choices objectively.
4. **Record Both Pros and Cons**: A balanced decision record explicitly documents accepted downsides and operational costs.
5. **Immutable History**: Once an ADR is accepted, do not edit its historical decision text; create a new ADR that supersedes the prior one.
