# System Design & Modularity

## Overview
This skill guides AI agents and engineers in decomposing system requirements into maintainable, modular components while preventing architectural decay, circular dependencies, and leaky abstractions.

## Core Directives
1. **Define Explicit Boundaries**: Every module must expose a strict public API (e.g. index file or port interface) and hide internal implementation helpers.
2. **Enforce Directional Dependencies**: High-level business policies must never depend on low-level technical mechanisms (database drivers, network protocols). Apply Dependency Inversion.
3. **Prevent Circular References**: Maintain a strict Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) across modules and packages.
4. **Cohesion Over Fragmentation**: Avoid arbitrary file splitting. Keep concepts that change together within the same domain boundary.
5. **Protect the Domain with ACLs**: Isolate third-party schemas and external API changes through an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL).
6. **Automate Architecture Verification**: Codify layer boundaries into automated Architectural Fitness Functions.
