# Test-Driven Verification

## Overview
This skill guides AI agents and engineers in constructing reliable, isolated test suites that verify real runtime correctness. It reinforces the invariant that **implementation is merely a hypothesis until verified by passing tests**.

## Core Directives
1. **Zero Assumed Success**: Always run test suites and inspect actual execution output. Never report that tests pass without executing the command.
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)**: Structure every test case into three distinct phases for unambiguous readability.
3. **Hermetic Isolation**: Tests must run independently in any order without relying on shared mutable state or network side-effects.
4. **Mock Only at Boundaries**: Never mock domain entities or business logic; mock only external system boundaries (network I/O, clock, payment gateways).
5. **Verify Invariants with Property-Based Tests**: For parsers, mathematical algorithms, and state transitions, assert invariants across generative random fuzzing.
6. **Guard Against Vanity Coverage**: Use mutation testing principles to ensure assertions are meaningful and capable of catching real regressions.

## 🛑 Anti-Rationalization Matrix

| Agent Excuse / Shortcut | Verification Reality | Mandatory Action |
|---|---|---|
| *"The code is obviously correct, tests aren't needed."* | Code that seems obvious still contains boundary failures (null, empty, overflows). | Write test cases verifying the happy path and edge cases. |
| *"I'll write tests after I finish coding."* | Retrofitted tests suffer from confirmation bias and rarely test failure paths. | Practice Red-Green-Refactor: write the failing assertion first. |
| *"I can't run tests in this environment."* | Without execution proof, the task state is [ASSUMED], not [VERIFIED]. | Run the test command and capture terminal stdout before completing. |
