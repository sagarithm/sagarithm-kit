# Secure Development & Vulnerability Prevention

## Overview
This skill guides AI agents and engineers in constructing software that resists malicious exploitation. Security is not an afterthought; it is built into every architectural boundary, input schema, cryptographic comparison, and database query.

## Core Directives
1. **Never Commit Secrets**: Prevent API keys, tokens, or credentials from entering git history. Use environment configuration.
2. **Validate at the Perimeter**: Parse and validate all external payloads using strict schemas before business logic processing.
3. **Prevent Injection by Default**: Use parameterized queries for databases and structured argument arrays for process executions.
4. **Enforce Least Privilege**: Run processes and queries with the minimal permissions necessary.
5. **Mitigate Timing Attacks**: Always use constant-time comparison functions when evaluating tokens, signatures, or HMACs.
6. **Defend Against SSRF**: Validate resolved IP addresses of external URLs to block internal network access and cloud metadata exploitation.
